# BloomFilter
A Bloom Filter project created for my Algorithm Design and Analysis course(CIIC 4025), on Fall Semester 2021.

Technologies used: python3 and MurmurHash3 Library.
Input: Two .csv files, one containing the list to be hashed, and another containing the list used for comparison, or verification.
Output: One .csv file indicating whether the items in the hashed list are probably, or not, in the 'database' based on the compared list. 

It uses a false positive rate of 0.0000001 to filter the items.
